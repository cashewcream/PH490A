Table.3 Infant mortality rate (probability of of dying between birth and age 1 per 1000 live births), World Health Data Repository

Table.4 Using the World Health Data Repository, we found the current health expenditure (CHE) per capita in US dollar. Then, we created a line chart showing lines for each country from the oldest date to the most recent date 2000, 20005, 2010, and 2015.

Table.5 We built histogram from the hysterctomy data and frequency distribution table from previous assignment.

Table.6 We created a column chart with the percentage of the total population who are uninsured for 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 in Louisana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington using the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Heptatis, STD, and TB Prevention Atlas from the CDC Database Systems.
